		<p><b>About</b></p>
		<p>Hello ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Luke Scott a computer science graduate from England, and I build all sorts of programs, websites and video games. </p><br>

		<p>Not too long ago I was playing a game of CIV VI with a friend; while setting up the game I wanted to have a randomized setup but still maintain some control. This resulted in the creation of the "Map Randomizer".</p><br>

		<p>Another issue I encountered was when playing a TSL earth game. I wanted to have randomized AI civilizations, however Europe becomes easily too busy and the Americas can be too empty. This resulted in the creation of the "Regional Civilization Randomizer". Certain civilizations are spread across multiple continents, and so I decided to use starting regions instead. Some civilizations are classified as in Eurasia and will randomly be added to either Europe or Asia.</p><br>

		<p>I plan on updating the website as new civilizations/DLC releases. I also plan on redoing some part of the  site as this was made as a personal tool and I took a few shortcuts when making it.</p><br>
